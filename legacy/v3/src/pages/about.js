        I love working on web technologies like Laravel, Node.js, React, and
        Vue. Also a little bit of Java (Hibernate), Docker, and server related
        things. I have worked on several collaborative projects, mostly internal
        dashboards, private information systems, and campus lab projects such as{' '}
        <Link href="https://inforlabs.net">Inforlabs</Link>.
      </p>

        I also attend and participate in local tech communities such as{' '}
        <Link href="https://surabayajs.org">SurabayaJS</Link> and{' '}
        <Link href="http://surabayadev.org">SurabayaDev</Link>. Outside the
        programming-verse, I hang around on Twitter, or coffee shops and
        co-working spaces in real life. I don’t play games that much anymore,
        but still hunt some sales on Steam and Origin.
