What a journey.

From a time where I tried blogging using Blogger, and then Tumblr, and now here I am writing my first blog post on my personal corner on the web powered with Markdown and GatsbyJS. Amazing.

Fun fact: I considered other blogging platforms before scaffolding this blog for days. [DEV Community](https://dev.to) is a great place to write programming stuff, but having a personal blog works for other kind of topics. [Ghost](https://ghost.org) is also great, but it's either paid managed instance or host it myself. And don't get me started about [Medium](https://medium.com/), which is just [paywall madness](https://www.google.com/search?q=medium+paywall).

I still have plans to write stuff on DEV and Medium, and append a canonical link which navigates to the exact post here. Or maybe just on DEV. Or just here. Who knows.
